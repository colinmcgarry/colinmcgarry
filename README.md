Hi, I’m Colin McGarry
I’m interested in applying my passion for math and statistics to my love of baseball, and using my skills in data science to better understand baseball statistics. I also have an interest in economic data, and exploring how policies in different countries impact economic metrics.
I’m currently learning SQL, I have more extensive experience using R and R Studio.
